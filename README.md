## About book
Nowadays, front-end development is no walk in the park, but Vue tries simplifying it by offering flexibility, declarative rendering, and reactivity.

Vue 3 improves upon Vue 2 by addressing its limitations. It's versatile, suitable for small and large applications, and offers better TypeScript support. The Vite build tool ensures rapid development times. The Composition API empowers developers to create robust logic, with the option to stick to Vue 2 syntax through the Options API. Vue's ecosystem libraries and community provide solutions and assistance to common problems.

As the name suggests, in this book, you will learn step by step in a progressive manner the following topics:

The essentials of Vue 3, reactivity API in Composition API with examples in TypeScript.
Component communication and reusability with Composables and Custom directives.
Using Vue ecosystem libraries like Vee-Validate, Vue-Router, VueUse, Pinia, Vitest, etc
To test, automate, and deploy your application with considerations on Performance, Security, and Accessibility.
After completing this book, you'll have the confidence and practical skills to utilize Vue 3 professionally and effectively.
